This code is a multi-currency forex indicator developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to simplify trend analysis in 28 different markets. 

## Input Parameters

- IndicatorPeriod: The period used for the indicator calculation (default: 14)
- StopLoss: The stop loss level for the pending orders (default: 100.0)
- TakeProfit: The take profit level for the pending orders (default: 200.0)

## Global Variables

## Custom Indicator Initialization

The custom indicator initialization function checks if all required indicators are available. If any indicators are missing, an error message is printed and the initialization fails. It also sets the chart properties, disabling auto-scroll and shifting the chart by one bar.

## Custom Indicator Iteration

The custom indicator iteration function calculates the indicator values and checks for intersections of the indicator. If a bullish trend is identified, a BUYSTOP pending order is placed with the entry, stop loss, and take profit prices calculated based on the ask price. If a bearish trend is identified, a SELLSTOP pending order is placed with the entry, stop loss, and take profit prices calculated based on the bid price. The function also creates a trend line object on the chart to visually represent the pending order.

## Check if All Required Indicators Exist

The `IndicatorsExist()` function checks if all required indicators are available. It uses the `iCustom()` function to check the existence of Indicator1, Indicator2, and Indicator3. If any of the indicators are missing, the function returns false.

## Calculate Indicator Value

The `CalculateIndicatorValue()` function calculates the indicator value at the specified index. It uses the `iCustom()` function to retrieve the values of Indicator1, Indicator2, and Indicator3 at the given index and sums them up.
